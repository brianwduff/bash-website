I was head organizer of the 3rd Annual Carnegie Mellon <a href="http://www.cmudonutdash.com/" target="_blank">Donut Dash</a>, benefiting the <a href="http://www.chp.edu/CHP/Home" target="_blank">Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh</a>. I, with the help of my committee, secured sponsorship from local businesses, formed an advertising campaign, screen-printed event T-shirts, maintained a website, and organized race-day logistics. We attracted nearly 200 runners, 60 volunteers, and raised over $7,500 for the Children's Hospital.
