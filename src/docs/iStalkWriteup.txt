iStalk is a project I did as a group of 4 for <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece549/" target="_blank">18-549</a>, the embedded systems capstone at CMU, in the spring of my junior year. It is designed to bring targeted ads to consumers in a location with multiple businesses, such as a mall, or in a large store. It uses facial recognition and Wi-Fi trilateralization to determine the location and preferences of consumers.
