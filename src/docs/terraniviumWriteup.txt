<a href="http://www.thenr.net/terranivium/" target="_blank">Terra Nivium</a> is an online war strategy game that two of my good friends and I wrote from scratch the summer before we went off to college. The site was coded in PHP and JavaScript with a MySQL backend. We opened up a beta to our friends and got 40 players signed up but the fun for us was in the coding and we have let it lapse since.
