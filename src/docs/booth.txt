I was in charge of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon booth for Carnegie Mellon's 2011 <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~sc0v/booth.html" target="_blank">carnival</a>. We recreated Bluth's frozen banana stand from the TV series Arrested Development. We sold frozen bananas for 50 cents apiece and donated more than $200 to the <a href="http://www.chp.edu/CHP/Home" target="_blank">Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh</a>. I was in charge of purchasing supplies, overseeing construction of the booth, acquiring permits to sell food, and organizing volunteers to man the booth. Our booth won the Chairman's Choice Award.
